# IntelligentSIDC
Highly dynamic Intelligent system which has the tendency to traverse, sort, and print upto 1 million keys in less than 3 seconds. 
ADTs used here are a combination of (AVL trees + Red-Black Trees) for bigger threshold and (a hashtable of array of LinkedList Nodes) for smaller threshold. 
Dynamically transforms the entire ADT into another if the current threshold exceeds or recedes the threshold.
